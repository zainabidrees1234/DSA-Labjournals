# Week 5 - Priority Queue Implementation in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a **Priority Queue** using an array of **Queue** objects. The program allows inserting elements with different priority levels and removes them in order of priority.

## üìå Features
- Generic `Queue` class using **templates**.
- `PQueue` (Priority Queue) that manages multiple priority levels.
- Supports **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** behavior within the same priority level.
- Handles **Queue overflow** and **underflow** conditions.
- **Dynamic memory allocation** for efficient memory management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Files in the Repository
- `Queue.h` - Implementation of a generic queue.
- `PQueue.h` - Implementation of a priority queue using multiple queues.
- `Source.cpp` - Main program demonstrating the functionality.

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run
Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., **g++**) installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
