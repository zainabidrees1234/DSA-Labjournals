## Week 3 Topics
In Week 3, we studied recursive functions, including their applications and implementations. Topics covered include:
- Factorial function
- String reversal using recursion
- Power function calculation
- Ackermann function
- Recursive number printing
- Binomial coefficient calculation
- Prime number checking using recursion

## Examples
### Example 3.1: Factorial Function
A simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

### Example 3.2: Reverse a String
A recursive function to reverse a given string.

### Example 3.3: Power Function
Computes X^N recursively.

### Example 3.4: Ackermann Function
Implements Ackermann's function, a classic recursive function example.

## Exercises
### Exercise 3.1: Power Function
Prints a table of powers of 2 up to 2^20 using recursion.

### Exercise 3.2: Ackermann Function
Demonstrates the Ackermann function with a given set of values.

### Exercise 3.3 (a): Print Numbers Down to 0
Recursively prints numbers from n to 0.

### Exercise 3.3 (b): Binomial Coefficient
Computes the binomial coefficient using a recursive approach.

### Exercise 3.3 (c): Prime Number Check
Determines if a number is prime using recursion.
