# C++ OOP Examples and Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples and exercises in C++. The code covers fundamental OOP concepts such as function overloading, operator overloading, templates, file handling, and class-based programming.

## Content
### Examples

- **Example 1.1**: Function passing by value, reference, and pointer.
- **Example 1.2**: Complex number operations using classes and operator overloading.
- **Example 1.3**: Function templates for finding the maximum value.
- **Example 1.4**: Class templates for finding the maximum of two values.
- **Example 1.5**: Class templates with fixed-size arrays for storing and retrieving elements.
- **Example 1.6**: File handling - reading from and writing to files.
- **Example 1.7**: Reading student data from a file and calculating averages.

### Exercises

- **Exercise 1.1**: Overloading the `*` operator for complex number multiplication.
- **Exercise 1.2**: Implementing a class template to find the minimum of two values.
- **Exercise 1.3**: Extending class templates with additional methods (`getmax()` and `getmin()`).
- **Exercise 1.4**: File handling program to count characters, words, and sentences in a file.
- **Exercise 1.5**: A class for managing house details, including reading and displaying data.
- **Exercise 1.6**: A student data management program that calculates and analyzes grades from a file.
